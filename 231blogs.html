            <h2>Week 1</h2>
            <h4><em>Give a brief description of your family background, education, personal history, beliefs and values and potential biases. Use the UNSDGs, Design programme Kawa, or another other critical lens you think relevant to help frame your discussion on values / biases.</em></h4>

            <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Growing up in an affluent, predominantly white community in the U.S. is typically a recipe for ignorance, prejudice, and an undeserved sense of righteousness. Thankfully, the community I grew up in was a liberal and secular island town. Being only a short ferry ride from Seattle, one of the biggest ports on the West Coast of the United States, makes the small town of Bainbridge Island seem much more significant. This allowed for much more emphasis on Whānu than the typical small town in America and made for a large but tight-knit community.
                </br></br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My parents were and still are sailing enthusiasts, hauling my brother and sister on a two-year voyage around the world at ages 14 and 12, respectively. Along the way, I was born in Whangarei, and shortly thereafter, they returned to the U.S. with me in tow. After settling on Bainbridge, they returned to land and bought a house where we lived for several years. In 2008 a major recession hit the U.S., making it challenging to own a house; this, combined with my siblings’ graduation to university, drove my parents and me back to sea. So, I went through the rest of my childhood living onboard a sailboat for 12 years until I graduated from high school.
                </br></br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Citizens of the U.S. can be particularly prone to bias as nationalism is practically indoctrinated through schooling and media. However, my privileged and sheltered upbringing ironically further distanced me from any strong sense of blind patriotism, and encouragement of critical thinking allowed me to grow up without viewing my surroundings through rose-tinted glasses. Instead, I noticed the glaring lack of equality, the obscenity of the rich and the abject poverty of so many in the country. While so many of my fellow Americans shouted about their being the “best in the world”, I saw a system built on injustice and lies while they distracted the masses with the American dream that was only attainable by a select few.

            <h4><em>Use your notes from class and your Personal Position above to expand your diary. Is there anything you might want to change now you've thought about it?

            <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wake up to a gentle rocking, accompanied by the distant lapping of waves that emanates from beneath me. I stretch out careful not to wake my wife up and climb out of bed and groggily wobble to the kitchen that lay beyond our bedroom. I add water and ground coffee into the coffee maker and fire up the stove. While they were heating, I peered out the porthole that sat above the stove to gaze at the harbour that surrounded us. Boats passed by out the window, and a haze clung along the coastline as was so common in cities these days. Turning my attention back to the cooking, I added a bacon substitute to a pan I had placed on the stove, along with some eggs. These days meat was too expensive, likely for the best as the emissions involved with the industry finally became too dire to ignore any longer. Still, obviously, it was too little too late.
                </br></br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My wife emerged, likely drawn by the aromas and delightful sizzling that accompanied them. We chatted over breakfast for a while before the smart clock on the wall chimed into our conversation to remind her that she had to leave for work. We said our goodbyes for the day as she donned a mobile oxygen mask, necessary as the air in cities was far from healthy these days. I waved her off from the bow with coffee in hand and then decided it was time for me to get around to my day's chores. I began by using recycled seawater to spray down the boat, a mid-sized catamaran we had bought a few years back. It had turned out to be a great investment, with rising sea levels along with devastation from natural disasters, the property market had become ridiculous, and only the very wealthy could afford homes at all anymore. Plus this sailboat allowed us to easily come and go when we wanted to escape the city and go somewhere where we could breathe without a mask.
                </br></br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I went about my day, 3D modelling disaster relief ideas as my job as an independent contractor for emergency services required. Midway through the day I got a notification my groceries were close, so I got up and rolled out a small sleek rug-like object on the deck. Before long I heard a buzz from above as a small drone lowered a crate onto the deck. I grabbed the crate and switched it with last week, full of rubbish and recycling. The drone picked up its new load and flew off.  I busied myself offloading the groceries and preparing for dinner, and before long I heard steps and then my wife descended the stairs, closing the door and airlock behind her. We had dinner and talked about our days before watching TV and going to bed.

            <h2>Week 2</h2>

            <h4><em>What are the key features of Speculative design? How does it differ from the design frameworks you’ve encountered on the Design programme so far? </em></h4>
            <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speculative design both opposes affirmative design and compliments it in various ways. Affirmative design has the goal of answering questions, while Speculative design acknowledges that some problems don’t need the quickest answer, but rather a closer examination of the problem. To accomplish this, Speculative design asks questions and puts forward designs that make you think critically. This can accomplish more than providing an easy answer to a problem. Grabbing the attention of a wider audience and directing their thoughts so they can independently view the problem and come to their own solutions, bringing much more awareness to an issue.
                </br></br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Affirmative design is what most think of when they think of design, and it will always have a place in the world as some problems will need convenient solutions. In fact, this is what I had previously imagined as what all of the design had entailed. However, exploring speculative design has lots of potential benefits. What comes to mind for me is that our society is like a sinking boat. Affirmative design is like throwing tape over the holes to try and stop us from sinking, whereas Speculative design takes a step back and asks why is the boat sinking, and imagines what happens in the future when the boat does sink. Both are important, but the theoretical thinking involved with Speculative design is what makes it so powerful.
                </br></br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nobody can predict the future, however, being prepared is the best we can do. Speculative design asks open-ended questions that spark thought and conversation on topics that may not normally be addressed. Showing society a future that is both entirely possible as well as horrifying is an amazing way to get people to address current problems. This mode of design challenges the idea that products can solve everything, and could help society finally break away from the clutches of consumerism. If Affirmative design is solution solving for the present then Speculative design is exploring the problems of the future.
            </p>

            <h4><em>What are the strengths/limitations of this mode of design?</em></h4>
            <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speculative design moves away from product-based market dictations and focuses on the theoretical. This makes this mode of design powerful as well as limited. Powerful as it can spark conversation and thought on big and important concepts that may be ignored normally out of convenience. This design presents a future, often shocking enough that makes the topic unavoidable. By blurring the lines of fiction and reality, these futures may seem far-fetched, yet not implausible and sometimes entirely possible, like holding up a warped mirror up to society. Often this design is accomplished through very modern and creative ways, making these futures visually striking, and often quite beautiful as well as alarming. Much of Speculative design draws its roots in contemporary art, yet can also potentially reach a wider audience than a painting could due to the target demographics involved. An artist often makes art as a form of self-expression to be interpreted by others, and a speculative designer may create to target a wider audience of industries and individuals.
                </br></br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speculative design does have certain limitations of course. Since it is entirely speculative, these futures it proposes may never even come close to passing making it a potentially fruitless effort. Moreover, the open-ended nature of Speculative design makes it open to interpretation a lot of the time, some may miss the point or come to the wrong conclusion entirely. Speculative design also is not meant to be selling a specific product or service, so there is not much of a market to sell Speculative design in. Then again, Speculative design seemingly wants to go against the status quo and make a difference in the world, which is hard to put a price on.

            <h2>Week 3</h2>

            <h4><em>What is the Pluriverse and what is Pluriversal Design? How could a Pluriversal Design approach improve a Speculative Design?</em></h4>
            <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pluriverse is an alternative to the colonial ideal of inclusion. Inclusion may sound helpful in theory, however, the last thing minority groups need is one group deciding what is best for them without any consultation. The Pluriverse is a correction to this idea, whereby each community is independent yet collaborative towards a goal allowing for each viewpoint to be heard, valued, and acted on. Pluriversal Design takes this one step further in actively utilizing these viewpoints to design a future that is not forcing everyone into one inclusive endpoint but rather into a future where everyone can be contently coexisting in the way that suits them best. Inclusion often tries to navigate through issues in a way that will be best for the majority, often ignoring the minority groups' needs entirely in favour of building a one-size-fits-all solution to the problem. Pluriversal Design operates under the assumption that everyone has different values and needs, then actively tries to find a solution that will work for all people, not just the majority.
                </br></br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Pluriversal Design is combined with Speculative Design it can be a truly powerful way to problem solve for the future. Speculative Design as it is now often operating under a more inclusive lens by imaging one future for everyone, with the Pluriversal lens added to it this could be expanded to imagine a future fit for everyone with culture and individuality preserved. A Pluriversal future should consider the needs and goals of people in different communities, ethnicities, religions, and viewpoints and build a future where everyone is safe to express themselves authentically while still emphasizing cross-cultural collaboration. This mode of design allows for more thought expression and many more viewpoints on an issue, possibly even bringing concerns or ideas to light that would otherwise never be considered otherwise and plans for a diverse future where nobody is forced into a solution, they aren’t comfortable with.

            <p>


                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Video games are now more popular than ever, with the industry now being larger than film, music and sports. Additionally, they are now more accessible than ever being able to be played from your laptop, phone or console. Yet, with all this advancement there is a sore lacking of diversity in the indie gaming field, most games being from big companies or small design studios with the industry, by and large, being dominated by white males. This exhibit showcasing six video games brings some relief with the creative twists and self-expression being showcased in the games. The designers were a mix of minorities of first nations peoples, women, and self-aware settlers.
                </br></br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The games are all quirky and give a-typical game experience filled with creativity. The games range from a relaxing meditative experience to a game inspired by the artist's struggle with Bipolar Disorder, to a crappy home designer as a commentary on popular games like Animal Crossing that emphasizes capitalist ideals, and even a game where you play as a plastic bag drifting over an area. All the games are modes of conveying thought and emotion to the player in an interactive way, taking a step above 3D renderings to be able to actually step into the artists’ creations. Providing the opportunity to take the step into the artist's creation and experience their thoughts and experiences in a narrative format is powerful and arguably more impactful than any painting could be as the interactive element can allow for to engage in the creation in a way typical art cannot do. This project shows six individual designers of different backgrounds that made their own game and could be a great inspiration to younger generations that they too could go through this artistic process and create their own interactive work of art and help diversify the field further.

            <h2>Week 4</h2>

            <h4><em>What are the key features of Transition design? How does it differ from the design frameworks you’ve encountered on the Design programme so far?</em></h4>

            <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transition design focuses more on design for the future in the context of the present, tackling complex problems that may be inexplicable to describe with other design methods. Taking a wide look at the individual parts that make up society in an ideal called a holarchy. This approach looks toward the future and sets a goal for where you want to be in the future. Once a goal is set for the future, you then trace that goal to the present in a process called back casting. Bridging the future goal to where you are in the present it makes the goal more accessible. To be able to backcast effectively you must look at all the individual parts that will make this future possible. These individual parts are no more or less important than each other, they are both a part and a whole. By examining the components involved you can build a multi-layered approach to building a sustainable future that includes everyone. This end product is a co-designed vision of the future for everyone.
                </br></br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transition design accounts for possible sustainable futures and connects them to the present in a more grounded way than many modes of design. This can make for more realistic solutions to issues and even possibly be ready for problems that aren’t yet articulated. This approach has the potential to be very environmentally conscious through its future-based approach. Due to the holarchical approach, more viewpoints and communities are taken into account, connecting the steps toward the goal to the people it affects. Though, designing for the future is often described as trying to hit a moving target meaning even with an effective method you might still completely miss the mark on what will happen to make your proposed future go up in smoke. Due to the scope involved in transitional design, it could end up being more time consuming than some other modes of speculative design. Analyzing all areas in the holarchy to try and predict future trends or how to end up at the proposed future could end up being a daunting task filled with moving parts and other various complicating factors.
                </br></br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speculative design as a whole share many similarities with transitional design as both include a sort of future projection for how the world might be, but the similarities end there. Speculative design is often more attention-grabbing than transition design, with the products often inspiring shock or a sense of urgency in its viewers. This mode of design can be less practical and more of a form of design activism, where you show the worst case scenario of the future if a problem continues. This draws in the audience and inspires thought and a desire to change if done right. Transition design is often a much less bleak approach to solving an issue, instead noticing the problems around you and framing it in terms of a future without that issue. The process is also much different as you are co-designing this future and looking at all the components involved in making this goal possible and connecting it to the present day. The fact that this design takes in other viewpoints does make it similar to Indigenous Futurism, yet the scope of Transition design is often larger. The holarchy involved in Transition design takes in many communities and viewpoints as a whole and a part of a bigger whole and might be less focused on them individually because of it, while the Indigenous Futurism approach isolates one component of the system.

            <p>
                <strong><a href="https://transitionnetwork.org/about-the-movement/what-is-transition/">Case Study: Transition Network</a></strong><br /><br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transition Network is a movement of reimagining all aspects of community living. With the network expanding over 48 countries in communities of all kind—ranging from villages, towns, colleges, and cities. There are currently 23 Transition Hubs that connect these communites and provide support internationally. The goal of the project is to work for a future that is eco-friendly, socially accepting, resilient, and tight-knit with more participation in communal activities. These communities are working to reimagine the food sourcing system to be more local, providing local renewable energy and having more parks, nature and communal gathering spaces. Additionally, they work with the local-government to advance their goals, internally they foster the community and help reskill the residents to help localize the community further.
                </br></br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The network is a prime example of Transition design done right, with whole communities already on-board and actively working to further the Transition Network. The approach even has its own holarchy of people, communities, townships, cities, governments, and the larger movement that spans globally. The end goal of re-localizing work, food, economics, and communities is a noble one, especially in an increasingly digital age. The movement demonstrates that communal living is still very possible in a digital age and that they can in fact coexist. The places it has already been implanted in show proof that the future goal is attainable, and their working towards providing localized economics could reimagine living entirely and truly bring the networks into thriving self-sufficient communities. By providing more communal gathering areas as well as fostering the local connection, these areas are growing into friendly townships where you truly know your neighbour. Additionally, the steps being taken to provide local renewable energy and bring nature back into these areas are a great step towards reducing the eco-footprint of the community as well as creating a local food network to lessen waste going into landfills.

            <h2>Week 5</h2>

            <h4><em>Review your first blog (Future diary) and any more notes you have developed on your topic during class activities and personal research – taking into account your learnings from the last 5 weeks, what would you change? What do you want the future to look like now? Reimagine what your life would look, feel, smell, taste like in 2037. Have your three domains/topics changed? What do you think you want to focus on now, and why? </em></h4>
            <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the most part, my original position is unchanged. I still don’t have very high hopes for what the future holds for the world, though now I look at it more as a sort of twisted opportunity than a bleak fate that awaits us. My original blog started with me living on a boat in the year 2037, with water levels everywhere rising so rapidly that water living was now the most reliable way to find a home that wouldn’t be underwater in the future. Now looking back, I have drawn inspiration from that original blog in my three domains and has inspired the future I would like to investigate. The idea of living on/under water has always fascinated me, as a child growing up on a boat it was always something that inspired me. Now looking toward the future of melting ice caps, rising water levels, degrading air and water quality, and loss of biomass in the ocean it turns that inspiration into a desire for change. After the past five weeks, I have realized that as a designer this is something I can help work to change, or work to try and positively adapt to this bleak future. These past weeks have also made me realize that I was quite focused on myself in the year 2037 and ignored the positive social changes that have been happening around the world. So I would like to contrast the dystopian future with a future full of diversity and acceptance, of communities brought closer together after a repeated disaster.
                </br></br></br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sunlight played off my eyelids, the brightness making it impossible to fall back to sleep I rolled out of bed careful not to wake my wife and sauntered over to the kitchen. I set up a pot of coffee to brew and started cooking some breakfast—toast derived from seaweed protein and eggs from the local farm. My wife came over to the kitchen as I finished cooking, and we took to the balcony to eat. I set down my plate and took up my coffee to gaze over the surrounding landscape. The morning rays of light danced off the waves and shone through the windows of the town, a smattering of dome-shaped buildings clad in pastels of all colours and their pearlescent siding shimmered in the sun. Connecting the buildings were walkways ranging in size depending on the street all gently bobbing in the gentle morning waves. The sunrise painted the sky in red and yellow unobstructed by any land or structure in sight, instead, the water's surface extended off towards the horizon. I pondered how people in the city could live without seeing the grandeur of a simple sunrise, yet the smog and those areas had grown so bad most could barely even see the sun at midday.
                </br></br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I turned back to the table and went about eating and chatting before the time had come when we need it to be off to work. My wife worked at a small school near the centre of the town, and I worked in a design lab near the outskirts that was dedicated to keeping our floating community thriving. My job was to maintain and brainstorm new ways to deal with storms and hurricanes, currently whenever an emergency such as that arose our system would take effect and once everybody had returned to their home the airlocks would seal and the floating walkways would release the gas they had stored and the whole town would start to submerge so it was safe from the oncoming waves until the storm was over. The workday was typical meetings with other experts as well as locals who had mechanical issues in their homes or had ideas for bettering the community. After work, I took a walk-through town stopping at a restaurant as a surprise for dinner days were always packed at this time people laughed, stopped to chat, or yelled to each other over the din. By the time I got home, the sun was setting, and we ate out on the balcony once again. We drank wine and talked until the sun had fully set and the stars came out, here in the middle of the ocean the stars were still clear, and we were treated to a sky alight with life, and a gentle from the moon as it danced over the choppy surface that surrounded the town.
