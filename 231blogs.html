                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Growing up in an affluent, predominantly white community in the U.S. is typically a recipe for ignorance, prejudice, and an undeserved sense of righteousness. Thankfully, the community I grew up in was a liberal and secular island town. Being only a short ferry ride from Seattle, one of the biggest ports on the West Coast of the United States, makes the small town of Bainbridge Island seem much more significant. This allowed for much more emphasis on Whānu than the typical small town in America and made for a large but tight-knit community.
                    </br></br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My parents were and still are sailing enthusiasts, hauling my brother and sister on a two-year voyage around the world at ages 14 and 12, respectively. Along the way, I was born in Whangarei, and shortly thereafter, they returned to the U.S. with me in tow. After settling on Bainbridge, they returned to land and bought a house where we lived for several years. In 2008 a major recession hit the U.S., making it challenging to own a house; this, combined with my siblings’ graduation to university, drove my parents and me back to sea. So, I went through the rest of my childhood living onboard a sailboat for 12 years until I graduated from high school.
                    </br></br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Citizens of the U.S. can be particularly prone to bias as nationalism is practically indoctrinated through schooling and media. However, my privileged and sheltered upbringing ironically further distanced me from any strong sense of blind patriotism, and encouragement of critical thinking allowed me to grow up without viewing my surroundings through rose-tinted glasses. Instead, I noticed the glaring lack of equality, the obscenity of the rich and the abject poverty of so many in the country. While so many of my fellow Americans shouted about their being the “best in the world”, I saw a system built on injustice and lies while they distracted the masses with the American dream that was only attainable by a select few.

            <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wake up to a gentle rocking, accompanied by the distant lapping of waves that emanates from beneath me. I stretch out careful not to wake my wife up and climb out of bed and groggily wobble to the kitchen that lay beyond our bedroom. I add water and ground coffee into the coffee maker and fire up the stove. While they were heating, I peered out the porthole that sat above the stove to gaze at the harbour that surrounded us. Boats passed by out the window, and a haze clung along the coastline as was so common in cities these days. Turning my attention back to the cooking, I added a bacon substitute to a pan I had placed on the stove, along with some eggs. These days meat was too expensive, likely for the best as the emissions involved with the industry finally became too dire to ignore any longer. Still, obviously, it was too little too late.
                </br></br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My wife emerged, likely drawn by the aromas and delightful sizzling that accompanied them. We chatted over breakfast for a while before the smart clock on the wall chimed into our conversation to remind her that she had to leave for work. We said our goodbyes for the day as she donned a mobile oxygen mask, necessary as the air in cities was far from healthy these days. I waved her off from the bow with coffee in hand and then decided it was time for me to get around to my day's chores. I began by using recycled seawater to spray down the boat, a mid-sized catamaran we had bought a few years back. It had turned out to be a great investment, with rising sea levels along with devastation from natural disasters, the property market had become ridiculous, and only the very wealthy could afford homes at all anymore. Plus this sailboat allowed us to easily come and go when we wanted to escape the city and go somewhere where we could breathe without a mask.
                </br></br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I went about my day, 3D modelling disaster relief ideas as my job as an independent contractor for emergency services required. Midway through the day I got a notification my groceries were close, so I got up and rolled out a small sleek rug-like object on the deck. Before long I heard a buzz from above as a small drone lowered a crate onto the deck. I grabbed the crate and switched it with last week, full of rubbish and recycling. The drone picked up its new load and flew off.  I busied myself offloading the groceries and preparing for dinner, and before long I heard steps and then my wife descended the stairs, closing the door and airlock behind her. We had dinner and talked about our days before watching TV and going to bed.

            <h2>Week 2</h2>

            <h4><em>What are the key features of Speculative design? How does it differ from the design frameworks you’ve encountered on the Design programme so far? </em></h4>
            <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speculative design both opposes affirmative design and compliments it in various ways. Affirmative design has the goal of answering questions, while Speculative design acknowledges that some problems don’t need the quickest answer, but rather a closer examination of the problem. To accomplish this, Speculative design asks questions and puts forward designs that make you think critically. This can accomplish more than providing an easy answer to a problem. Grabbing the attention of a wider audience and directing their thoughts so they can independently view the problem and come to their own solutions, bringing much more awareness to an issue.
                </br></br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Affirmative design is what most think of when they think of design, and it will always have a place in the world as some problems will need convenient solutions. In fact, this is what I had previously imagined as what all of the design had entailed. However, exploring speculative design has lots of potential benefits. What comes to mind for me is that our society is like a sinking boat. Affirmative design is like throwing tape over the holes to try and stop us from sinking, whereas Speculative design takes a step back and asks why is the boat sinking, and imagines what happens in the future when the boat does sink. Both are important, but the theoretical thinking involved with Speculative design is what makes it so powerful.
                </br></br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nobody can predict the future, however, being prepared is the best we can do. Speculative design asks open-ended questions that spark thought and conversation on topics that may not normally be addressed. Showing society a future that is both entirely possible as well as horrifying is an amazing way to get people to address current problems. This mode of design challenges the idea that products can solve everything, and could help society finally break away from the clutches of consumerism. If Affirmative design is solution solving for the present then Speculative design is exploring the problems of the future.
            </p>

            <h4><em>What are the strengths/limitations of this mode of design?</em></h4>
            <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speculative design moves away from product-based market dictations and focuses on the theoretical. This makes this mode of design powerful as well as limited. Powerful as it can spark conversation and thought on big and important concepts that may be ignored normally out of convenience. This design presents a future, often shocking enough that makes the topic unavoidable. By blurring the lines of fiction and reality, these futures may seem far-fetched, yet not implausible and sometimes entirely possible, like holding up a warped mirror up to society. Often this design is accomplished through very modern and creative ways, making these futures visually striking, and often quite beautiful as well as alarming. Much of Speculative design draws its roots in contemporary art, yet can also potentially reach a wider audience than a painting could due to the target demographics involved. An artist often makes art as a form of self-expression to be interpreted by others, and a speculative designer may create to target a wider audience of industries and individuals.
                </br></br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speculative design does have certain limitations of course. Since it is entirely speculative, these futures it proposes may never even come close to passing making it a potentially fruitless effort. Moreover, the open-ended nature of Speculative design makes it open to interpretation a lot of the time, some may miss the point or come to the wrong conclusion entirely. Speculative design also is not meant to be selling a specific product or service, so there is not much of a market to sell Speculative design in. Then again, Speculative design seemingly wants to go against the status quo and make a difference in the world, which is hard to put a price on.

            <h2>Week 3</h2>

            <h4><em>What is the Pluriverse and what is Pluriversal Design? How could a Pluriversal Design approach improve a Speculative Design?</em></h4>
            <ul>
                <li>The pluriverse is an alternative to the colonial ideal of inclusion. In this vain of thought, it encourages people having spaces for all different people rather than trying to integrate everybody into one space. </li>
                <li>Pluriersal approach allows for everyone to express themselves authentically and be in a safe space for them while encouraging cross-cultural collaboration.</li>
                <li>Allows for many different perspectives rather than one group trying to enact what they think might be best for culture.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4><em>Find an example of Indigenous Futurism or a Critical Speculative design with a Pluriversal worldview not studied in class that you find interesting.</em></h4>
            <p><strong><a href="https://crossculturalchairs.com/">Cross Cultural Chairs</a></strong><br/>
            Cross cultural chairs is a project aiming to higlight cultural significances and celebrate differance in a vibrant and simple way. They have people create chairs in a style significant to their culture in an effort to straying from the modern enforcemnt of how chairs should be. This project showcases speculative critical design by presenting a commentary on modern expectations of what furniture should look like while providing a platform for cultural expression.
