			<h3>Phase 1: Research and Concept</h3>
            <p>I had a suprisingly difficult time ideating concepts for my artefact, as my area was floating cities my ideas were quite split between lesiure and transportation.</p>
			<h4>30 Ideas</h4>
			<ol>
			<li>Weaved Seaweed Clothing</li>
				<p>Sustainable fabric made from weaving seaweed</p>
			<li>Wind Tunnel Wind Surfing Arena</li>
				<p>Giant floating tunnel that has a big fan on one side that you windsurf through</p>
			<li>Human Powered Submersible Vehicle</li>
				<p>Like a paddleboat that is underwater and can utilise 3D movement</p>
			<li>Artificial Lilypad Paths</li>
				<p>Like the giant floating lilypads, only manmade. They have a small turbine on the bottom to stay in one place, can be lined up to make a path or used for decoration.</p>
			<li>Hydrofoil shoes</li>
				<p>Like a hydrofoil surfboard that are already being used but instead, each shoe has a hydrofoil. Could be a fun way to get around</p>
			<li>Underwater Garden</li>
				<p>An interactive garden underwater full of synthetically grown coral, as well as marine plants local to the area provides an ecosystem for indigenous life to visit, allowing for an aquarium-like garden. Could have glass tunnels for dry viewing as well as snorkeling and diving spots for closer experience</p>
			<li>Interactive Shark Cage</li>
				<p>Free floating shark cage vessel that provides a more holistic experience</p>
			<li>Floating Art using safe water dyes</li>
				<p>Like chalk on pavement but using water safe dyes</p>
			<li>Flash-freezing ice sculptures</li>
				<p>Machine able to flash freeze shapes like reverse 3D printing, could also use to make structures and paths</p>
			<li>Submersed tunnels kids can crawl around in and see through the glass into the water</li>
				<p>Underwater playground for kids with a tunnel network with viewing sections</p>
			<li>Docking Elevators</li>
				<p>AI-powered floating docks that have a locking mechanism that can connect them to houses so they can be used as elevators to get to upper-level houses. They can also be called to your door for convenience.</p>
			<li>Surf park</li>
				<p>Public park with wave making machines so people can surf in safety in a fun setting.</p>
			<li>Floating pods</li>
				<p>Like how parks have benches, these floating pods would have an inset area for sitting and a table, providing a place to eat, work, or study.</p>
			<li>Half-submerged Ferris wheel</li>
				<p>A Ferris wheel that is half submerged and half above the water so you get a variety of views.</p>
			<li>Rope Bridge Launcher</li>
				<p>By your door you have a screen that allows you to aim and fire a line to another building or door that expands and turns into a bridge connecting you.</p>
			<li>Hurricane-Proof Submerging Buildings</li>
				<p>Buildings can sink into the water to be fully submerged as to be out of the way come extreme winds and waves.</p>
			<li>Salt-maker</li>
				<p>Evaporates saltwater into clean water and salt</p>
			<li>Water Trampoline</li>
				<p>Device that breaks surface tension while jumping to use the pressure available to boost you back into the air.</p>
			<li>Bubble Movement</li>
				<p>Hamster-style floating bubbles that allow you to roll on the surface of the water.</p>
			<li>Water Walking Shoes</li>
				<p>Shoes that utilize a wide contact with the water to spread your weight out and not break the surface tension.</p>
			<li>Submarine Drones</li>
				<p>Drones that look like big fish can be operated to dive to the ocean floor as a means to explore.</p>
			<li>Floating Garden</li>
				<p>A garden made from buoyant plants and grasses as a base that other plants can use to grow, mangroves to strengthen the base as well.</p>
			<li>Rolling wind barrier</li>
				<p>Around the whole city there might be a wall to keep buildings contained, and there could be a giant wind break that is able to roll on tracks to face in the direction of wind naturally with innovative implementations of aerodynamics.</p>
			<li>Extension Aquarium</li>
				<p>Have you held a cup upsidedown underwater and then brought it to the surface, and the water still stays there? aquarium with the same effect in upturned glass terrariums that fish can swim up.</p>
			<li>Submerged slide.</li>
				<p>A slide that has a track on it propelling you allowing you to slide down and pop out the other side on land still</p>
			<li>Submerged Bridge.</li>
				<p>A bridge that goes underwater, and the entrance sits right on the surface, giving a viewing tunnel and community gathering place along with a place to walk through.</p>
			<li>Water Bike</li>
				<p>A bicycle that can ride on the surface of the water with its thick inflated tires and has two poles with buoyant ski like attachments so you can take corners without tipping over</p>
			<li>Neo Fishing.</li>
				<p>A new non-invasive fishing technique that utilises an underwater drone camera and a fishing line without a hook, only bait. When you usually catch the fish, it will take a photo of the fish that gets sent to the surface so you can view your catch in real-time</p>
			<li>Human Kites.</li>
				<p>Like hang gliding or kite surfing, except this device allows you to stay in a stationary position while suspended in the air by using wind and a motor.</p>
			<li>Floating Horseshoe</li>
				<p>Combining the horseshoe game with skipping rocks, you have to get close to the peg by skipping horseshoe like objects towards it.</p>
			</ol>
			<h4>Top Ideas</h4>
			<h5>Hydrofoil Shoes</h5>

            <div class="projOverlay">Human-Powered Submarine</div></div>
				
				<div class="galleryLink">
                <a href="#"> <img src="./illuvion/human-sub-draw.png"></a>
            <div class="projOverlay"></div></div>
					
			<h5>Final Choice: Floating Pod</h5>
					<div class="galleryLink">
                <a href="#"> <img src="./illuvion/dock-draw.png"></a>
            <div class="projOverlay"></div></div>
			<p>I chose this design because I liked its versatility and saw multiple uses for it. Furthermore, it had more purpose than the others as it could be used for private or public transport, used as an elevator or as a casual place to spend time with people. From there I began iterating the design</p>
			<div class="galleryLink">
                <a href="#"> <img src="./illuvion/Docking-scheme.png"></a>
            <div class="projOverlay">Original plans</div></div>
				
				<p>After a basic idea of my desired function I began deciding on the form and aesthetic</p>
				<h3>Phase 2: Develop</h3>
			<div class="galleryLink">
                <a href="#"> <img src="./illuvion/scheme.png"></a>
            <div class="projOverlay">Form sketch</div></div>
			
				<p>I had devised an idea for the shape and form that I though best fit the idea. <br/>
				I wanted the device to have an organic feel based on the shape of a seashell and to have an open-concept design. However I decided that it also needed
					to fit the enviorment so it needed safeguards against weather and saftey features</p>
				<div class="galleryLink">
                <a href="#"> <img src="./illuvion/moodboard.png"></a>
            <div class="projOverlay">Moodboard</div></div>
					
				<p>The key ideas for the design I decided on after my moodboard were:<br/><br/>
					Organic<br/> Regal <br/> Smooth <br/> Round </br> Bright</p>
				<p>I began considering materials that would fit with this vision, and decided on using wood that could be from repurposed driftwood, and glass to fit with the open-concept. since I had decided to base the form on a seashell I wanted to use nacre or mother of pearl for use as embelishment on the device as it could tie together the shape with the regal and bright themes.</p>
				<br/>
				<p>I wanted to begin prototyping a physical model, but unfortunately my girlfriend had just gotten off a plane from the US the on 19th. I didn't want to risk spreading covid to anyone after being in close contact so I decided to play it safe and focus on making a digital prototype.<br/><br/>I began in Blender by making a flat plane making an aproximate shape and combining other shapes together to make a base. This took quite a while to find a good base form that resmbled a seashell. However, once I had it made I began filling in details.</p>

            <div class="projOverlay">Intital Render</div></div>
				<p>I used an organic shape that I based on Greek vases for the pillars on the device, and was quite happy with the progress. This was as far as I had gotten before the last progress check</p>
					
				<h3>Deliver</h3>
					<div class="galleryLink">
                <a href="#"> <img src="./illuvion/prog-0.png"></a>
            <div class="projOverlay">Roof and Fence</div></div>
				<p>I added a fence and a a roof that all connected to the pillars</p>
					
					<div class="galleryLink">
                <a href="#"> <img src="./illuvion/prog-1.png"></a>
            <div class="projOverlay">Fence material</div></div>
				<p>I then began creating a procedurally generating wood texture by following several tutorials then finishing off the details on my own.</p>
						
			<div class="galleryLink">
                <a href="#"> <img src="./illuvion/prog-2.png"></a>
            <div class="projOverlay">Locking mechanism</div></div>
				<p>I created a locking mechanism that would be used to connect to other pods or buildings when they need to use their elevator function.</p>
				
			<div class="galleryLink">
                <a href="#"> <img src="./illuvion/prog-3.png"></a>
            <div class="projOverlay">HDR Addition</div></div>
				
			<div class="galleryLink">
                <a href="#"> <img src="./illuvion/prog-4.png"></a>
            <div class="projOverlay">HDR Addition</div></div>
				
				<p>Backgrounds in Blender use HDR files which allow for a 3D global background. I found some free options for an ocean scene and added them</p>
				
			<div class="galleryLink">
                <a href="#"> <img src="./illuvion/prog-5.png"></a>
            <div class="projOverlay">Glass and Nacre</div></div>
				<p>I then added in more textures, a glass for the floor, celing, and railings as well as a procedurally generated nacre after following another tutorial.</p>
			
			<div class="galleryLink">
                <a href="#"> <img src="./illuvion/prog-6.png"></a>
            <div class="projOverlay">Glass and Nacre</div></div>
			
			<div class="galleryLink">
                <a href="#"> <img src="./illuvion/prog-7.png"></a>
            <div class="projOverlay">Glass and Nacre</div></div>
			
				
				<p>I still needed a floor texture to tweak some of the smaller parts.</p>
			<div class="galleryLink">
                <a href="#"> <img src="./illuvion/prog-8.png"></a>
            <div class="projOverlay">Floor</div></div>
				
			<div class="galleryLink">
                <a href="#"> <img src="./illuvion/prog-9.png"></a>
            <div class="projOverlay">Tweaks</div></div>
						<p>I felt the pod needed some more life inside so I created a table and chairs to fill space.</p>
				
			<div class="galleryLink">
                <a href="#"> <img src="./illuvion/furn-blank.png"></a>
            <div class="projOverlay">Furniture form</div></div>
					
			<div class="galleryLink">
                <a href="#"> <img src="./illuvion/furn-style.png"></a>
            <div class="projOverlay">Stylized</div></div>
				
				<h4>Renders</h4>
				<p>After all that iteration and stylizing I felt ready to render</p>
			
			<div class="galleryLink">
                <a href="#"> <img src="./illuvion/basic-render.png"></a>
            <div class="projOverlay">First render</div></div>
				<p>I felt like I was missing an aspect of it still so I made a complex water texture to supplement the renders following a long and informative, if complex, tutorial.</p>
				
			<div class="kitchen-photos">
                <a href="#"> <img src="./illuvion/shader-water.png"></a>
				
                <a href="#"> <img src="./illuvion/water.png"></a>
            </div>
		
				<div class="galleryLink">
                <a href="#"> <img src="./illuvion/beauty-rend-upside.png"></a>
            <div class="projOverlay">Render with water</div></div>
					
					<div class="galleryLink">
                <a href="#"> <img src="./illuvion/beauty-rend-top.png"></a>
            <div class="projOverlay">Render with water</div></div>
				
					<div class="galleryLink">
                <a href="#"> <img src="./illuvion/beauty-rend-longlegs.png"></a>
            <div class="projOverlay">Render with water</div></div>
						
						
			<p>I enjoyed the result but I wanted a more thematic background so I switched the HDR I used</p>
					
						<div class="galleryLink">
                <a href="#"> <img src="./illuvion/beauty-rend-side.png"></a>
            <div class="projOverlay">Render with new HDR</div></div>
							<div class="galleryLink">
                <a href="#"> <img src="./illuvion/beauty-rend-frontangle.png"></a>
								<div class="projOverlay">Render with new HDR</div></div>
								<div class="galleryLink">
                <a href="#"> <img src="./illuvion/beauty-rend-coverpage.png"></a>
									<div class="projOverlay">My favorite render</div></div>
									
			<p>Rather late in the process I realised I had missed placing the monitor inside, though it worked out as I adapted to have the monitor be retractable into the base as needed to conserve space. I found a picture online of a futuristic monitor and added an adress as if the pod was moving to it.</p>
									<div class="galleryLink">
                <a href="#"> <img src="./illuvion/monior-text.png"></a>
										<div class="projOverlay">Monitor texture</div></div>
										<div class="galleryLink">
                <a href="#"> <img src="./illuvion/beauty-rend-monitor.png"></a>
											<div class="projOverlay">Render with monitor</div></div>
											<p>Now that I had solid renders showing all the different angles I wanted one final output to tie the functionality in with the project and really showcase it. I have never done animations in Blender before but I figured now was as good a time as any to learn. I created a small basic few story building and began assembling a timeline with the pod moving to it and escaliting to the third floor before pausing and descending. The trickiest part was getting the camera to follow along with the movement. However, after I finished I was thrilled with the result.<br/><br/> I had to use a different rendering engine, as Blender's cycle render would have taken over 8 whole days to render all 250 frames. As such, the quality of each frame is slightly less quality and some of the textures didn't function as they were supposed to.</p>
