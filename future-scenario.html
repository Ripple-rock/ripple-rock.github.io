			<h3>Reaserch</h3>
            <p>My process started with diving into reaserch on the topic, my first step was looking into current projects being done. I found a few companies already planning to build floating cities, like Oceanix who partnered with the company UN-Habitat and the city of Busan to create a plan for a floating city. The proposal was beyond my expectations, it was based around fully sustainable technologies and seemingly had a plan for all possible shortcomings. The technologies proposed were quite varied but all complimented eachother, overall it seemed like a first step towards this future. I followed one person in particular relating to this project, Bjarke Ingels, a renowned architect and the man overseeing the Busan project. I watched a Ted Talk from him and read several articles but all attempts to reach out for an interview were fruitless. <br/> <br/>A similar project I found was for a floating city in the Maladives, this one is was almost more like a floating island and seemed to have a similar timeline to the other project. Again I tried reaching out for an interview and was met without a response. In fact I only recieved one response for all of my attempts of reaching out, and that response was to tell me that they were unable to provide an interview but could answer question yet didn't respond to any questions I asked.</p>

                <a href="#"> <img src="./floating-city/interview-2.png"></a>
            </div>
            <div class="galleryLink">

            <div class="projOverlay">Current floating projects</div>      
            </div>
			<p>Since I had no response from any of my interviewers, I dove into research. I moved on to the types of sustainable energy being used in the aformentioned projects and other new technologies I thought could be used in the future. This ranged from new technologies like floating tidal generators, O.T.E.C which uses the difference in temperature from different depths in the Ocean to create energy, and even new spins on old technology like solar panels that can extract moisture from the air to collect water. I tried reaching out to several different reaserching companies and energy companies for an interview and got no response back.</p>

            <div class="projOverlay">Floating energy</div>  
				<p>Then I dug into farming techniques that could be implemented in this setting. 3D Ocean Farming was the most promising techinque, it sustainibly grows organisms like clams, oysters, mussles and more and they boost local biodiversity by providing a habitat for new species, additonally they suck pollutants out of the water.</p>

            <div class="projOverlay">Floating farming</div>      
            </div>
			<p>I went on to reaserch other aspects of floating cities, like life on the water, testimonies of people who live on the water currently, and people opposed to floating cities.</p>

                <a href="#"> <img src="./floating-city/floating-living.png"></a>
            <div class="projOverlay">Living on water</div>      
            </div>
			<p>I dug into various tech that relates to this area, from transportation to delivery, sustainable and durable materials, and recycling. </p>
            <div class="galleryLink">

            <div class="projOverlay">Tech involved</div>      
            </div>
			<p>Lastly I dug more into the reasons why these cities would be helpful, the rising tides, increases in storms, and any other reason that floating cities would be needed.</p>

                <a href="#"> <img src="./floating-city/sea-lv-rise.png"></a>

			<h3>Insights</h3>
			<div class="galleryLink">
                <a href="#"> <img src="./floating-city/insights.png"></a>     
            </div>
			<p>My final insight was a combination of many of the themes I researched, the theme was with the damage already done to our environment and atmosphere, the ice is going to melt no matter what we do. So we have to find a way to account for the damage that is done while ensuring that we don't further wreck our climate, and my claim was that floating cities will do just that.</p>
			<p style="font-size: 25px;"><strong>"We need to limit environmental impact while accounting for damages done. Floating cities protect against future issues while saving the present with renewable and sustainable technologies."</strong></p>
			
			<h3>Timeline</h3>
		</div>
		<img src="./floating-city/timeline.png">
			<div class="pageBody">
				<p>My timeline starts with several attempts and plans for a marine city based out of Japan, these were mostly theoretical drawings and plans but served as a great start for the idea. Closer to the present, Waterstudion in the Nethelands has been building floating buildings and homes for close to 20 years, often resulting in fabulous structures. Schoonship in 2015 was a neighborhood built in collaboration with Waterstudion in Amsterdam. In 2020 a Dutch company called Marin tested a mega island by setting up similar conditions in a a pool and emulating weather and waves. In the close present, the floating city projects in Busan and Maladives are planned in collaboration with local governments. <br/> <br/> In the future, the Busan floating city is planned to be completed by 2025, and the Maladives by 2027. Beyond that I expect that by 2030, there will be a peak in global intrest over the new floating city phenomenon. By 2035 I expect that the new technolgies around sustainable aquatic fish farming will spread influence around the world, leading people away from beef due to its destructive nature. By 2040 I think buisnesses will move and start joining customers on the water. By 2050, it is expected that 800 million people will be displaced by rising water levels. I expect that many of them, already forced out of their home, will move to floating cities.</p>
				
			<h3>Visualisation Images</h3>
            <p>After reaserching and writing out my insights and scenario I started working on my visualization and my image. At first I was going to make an image in Illustrator, but after some work I thought there might be a better option. I have recently gotten into AI image generation and figured this would be a great project to use it on. The conceptual nature of floating cites gave me a lot to work with in terms of keywords to feed into the generator. I used the program called Midjourney, below is the final image I chose but I will also show the contenders.</p>
            <div class="galleryLink">
                <a href="#"> <img src="./floating-city/city1.jpg"></a>
            <div class="projOverlay"><span style="color: black;">Final image</span></div>      
            </div>
			
			<p>Other top images I considered:</p>
			<div class="kitchen-photos">
                <a href="#"> <img src="./floating-city/city2.jpg"></a>
                <a href="#"> <img src="./floating-city/city3.jpg"></a>
				<a href="#"> <img src="./floating-city/city4.png"></a>
                <a href="#"> <img src="./floating-city/city5.png"></a>
				<a href="#"> <img src="./floating-city/city6.png"></a>
				<a href="#"> <img src="./floating-city/city7.png"></a>
				<a href="#"> <img src="./floating-city/city8.png"></a>
				<a href="#"> <img src="./floating-city/city9.png"></a>
				<a href="#"> <img src="./floating-city/city10.png"></a>
            </div>
			
			
			<p>To get these I used a variety of keywords all focusing on the core "floating city" idea, some keywords I used to get the theme of the city -techno, -futuristic, -sci-fi, -steampunk, etc... I also alternated trying keywords like that with full on sentances. Prompts like "floating city on platforms in the ocean" "mega city floating through the sea" "floating city interconnected by bridges" and more. To get the quality of the piece up I would go through endless variations and iterations of keywords as well as including keywords that tell the AI to imitate a style. These keywords went along the lines of "ultra realistic" "highly detailed" "octane render" "photography" "fantasy realism" "unreal engine 5" "16k hd" "8k" "Nikon D750". These all let the AI know to look at images with similar tags to form a high quality image. I also included many other tags after trial and error until I found ones that fit the vibe I wanted.</p>
