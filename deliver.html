                <br/>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My client, Emma, was struggling to have time or motivation to cook. In a house where they live with other people, they often feel the kitchen is too tiny, accounting for appliances, utensils, and food that is kept out in the kitchen. Additionally, when they cook, they often are frustrated if they run out of room or would like extra space for a cutting board.<br/>

                <a href="#"> <img src="./deliver/full-view.jpg"></a>
                <div class="projOverlay">Cluttered counters, <br/>no room to cook!</div>
            </div>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though the problem doesn't seem huge, with someone who is already unmotivated to cook can lead them to choose to do something else entirely, like order food out. To combat this problem, I set to work. After my design process was finished, I had a product ready to help.

			<h2>Design & Prototyping</h2>
          
            
            <p>
				
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To test out the product idea, we prototyped the experience to understand how the product would practically work. I used a fold-up chessboard as the model as it had the approximate size and function needed.
				</p>
			
			<div class="kitchen-photos">
                <a href="#"> <img src="./deliver/fold-half.jpg"></a>
                <a href="#"> <img src="./deliver/fold-extended.png"></a>
            </div>
			
				<br/> <br/>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The prototype was simple but effective for conveying the project's core concept. My client, Emma, enjoyed the idea but felt they needed to be able to test it further, so I switched the chessboard for a cutting board and held it in the same place so they could cut an apple. After this, they were convinced. Without the need to clear any space and needing only a quick wipe afterwards, the idea was appealing to them. Once we were set on the concept, I got to work sketching. My client needed extra counter space on-demand without cluttering the kitchen further by taking up too much space. The final product would be able to "pop" out of the counter and lock back in when needed. The board would run on tracks to easily slide in and out. There would be a hinge in the middle allowing it to fold to be stowed and unfolded when out for maximum space.

            <h2>Designing</h2>
			<h3><center>The Basics:</center></h3>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a solid idea in place and a sketch to back it up, I was ready to begin designing, so I got to work in Blender.</p>
            <a href="#"> <img src="./deliver/outline-scheme.png" style="width: 70%";></a>
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I designed the product and what its reception would look like inside the counter. To have a solid understanding of the layout, I brought snapshots of it into photoshop to annotate and label it.</p>
			<div class="kitchen-photos">
                <a href="#"> <img src="./deliver/outline-scheme-side-annot.png"></a>
                <a href="#"> <img src="./deliver/to-edit-bot-outline.png"></a>
            </div>
		


            <h3><center>Making a Logo</center></h3>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I felt the product required a brand, so I needed a logo. I wanted the logo to be true to the product, something fitting it. I chose CounterEXT to be the name, simple and to the point.</p>
            <a href="#"> <img src="./deliver/CounterEXT logo ideas.png" style="width: 70%";></a>
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A logo that was simple, unique, and to the point. The red grabs attention, and the whitespace by it implies movement. The knife dividing the words indicates the use of the product and what to expect.</p>
			<a href="#"> <img src="./deliver/final-logo.png";></a>
			
		

		<h2>Stylizing</h2>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the logo in hand, I attached it to the product to see how it fit.</p>
            <a href="#"> <img src="./deliver/board-basic.png"></a>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I felt it was a nice improvement to the design. Although I thought the design should be simple, it needed some contrast. I began adding materials and changing colours till I found a sleek design I liked and a backdrop.</p>

            </div>
			
            <h3><center>Setting the Scene</center></h3>
           
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a solid product, I needed a scene to show it from the perspective of the environment it will be in. I began designing a kitchen to set up photos of the product and an apple and knife as props for use in the images. </p>
			<a href="#"> <img src="./deliver/kitchen-basic.png" style="width: 70%";></a>
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then I spent time learning how to make realistic materials in Blender, consulting several Youtube videos in the process.</p>

            <h2>Conslusions</h2>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Designing this product helped me learn about the difficulties involved with product design and the satisfaction involved in seeing an idea come to life. Showing the design to my client excited them to see something fit to deal with their issue. This also helped me see some of the drawbacks involved with the idea, the main one being that installation of the product requires disassembly of the existing counter to provide housing for it. This is not feasible for the average student, but it wouldn't be near as taxing to put into a kitchen that's being built or remodelled. Ultimately, I found myself wanting to bring the product to life, so I might be able to own one myself.

            </div>
				<br/>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going through a complete design process, countless brainstorming sessions and iterations of ideas and products gave me invaluable experience and helped me learn a great deal. In the future, I realized I need to keep the client even more in the loop and to be laxer in my initial designs, focusing on the volume of ideas that I can later tweak, combine, or scrap as needed. I also feel my 3D designing prowess has significantly improved. I got a handle on each step of the design process. With my previous practice, I found myself breezing through jobs that might have initially dumbfounded me and attempting more complex tasks that were met with success. In the end, I'm proud of my product and the process that helped it become a reality, and I'm more confident in my ability to design.
		<br/><br/>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reviewing my HMY statement, "How might we make cooking more accessible for those with limited time or space?", I believe that overall the project hit the mark. Granted, the installation may not be fit for everyone that has this issue so that does limit the success a bit. My client was content with the result, however, their feedback was that having some customizable options would help the product. This could be a change in the material of the cutting surface to fit the theme of the kitchen or for preference, instead of a durable plastic, some may choose a butcher block or other type of wood. If I were to redesign it, I would account for these variations and try out different materials for the base.v
