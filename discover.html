            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As someone who spends a great deal of time in the kitchen, I have experienced plenty of hang-ups and annoyances throughout my time as a home chef. Cooking is a skill that is hard to master, and even those considered masters still make plenty of mistakes. When it comes down to it, cooking is all about problem-solving at the moment, and as such, I have grown accustomed to disappointments and minor errors that can throw off a whole recipe. To me, this is part of the fun of cooking, the unpredictability that comes with altering recipes or making up dishes on the spot. However, one problem I run into frequently cooking in a home kitchen is lack of space. 
			<br/><br/>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While having to cook in tight quarters or with limited counter space may seem like a minor issue, it has led me to the most frustration of any problems I have encountered in the kitchen. A great deal of the other possible issues I’ve run into seems to have an easy fix in comparison to this issue. Yet, lack of space is something that is possible to work around but difficult to find an actual solution. Due to this problem, I often find myself diving across the kitchen to catch an ingredient before it topples off the counter, or I will find myself in the midst of several tasks only to realize I have no place to put a pot or pan. This biggest side-effect of lack of counter real estate has been me dropping or spilling ingredients or even dropping already cooked food. So what is the solution to finding more space in a cramped kitchen?

            <p>
				To get a broader idea of the issue, I spoke to a few people about their issues in the kitchen and gradually asked if they had any specific issues with the space involved in their kitchens and if it impacted their ability to cook. </p>
			<h3>Testimonies:</h3>
				<p><i>“As someone who needs things on the counter to see that they are there, it makes it hard to know if we have something as my brain tends to work on an out-of-sight mentality. I tend to forget that I have certain foods or fruits because my already limited counter-space is dominated by appliances, further shrinking the available space.” </i>- Emma
<br/><br/>
				<i>“If my counters are cluttered then I’m less inclined to cook. It feels like I have to do a bunch of extra work before even starting, so keeping my kitchen clear lets me focus just on the cooking aspect.”</i> - Jasper
<br/><br/>
				<i>“I don’t love to cook so I have a lot of appliances to help when I’m in the kitchen, the problem now being my counters get cluttered so easily I don’t have any place work. I already struggle getting around to cooking, and if I had more space it would at least make it easier for me to do that.”</i> -Rachael

			<h3>Observations</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>More counter space can make the cooking proccess easier.</li>
				<li>Less counter space can lead to less motivation to cook.</li>
				<li>It is easier to make mistakes due to the distractions of having a small space.</li>
				<li>Dropping things is much easier when you have little space.</li>
				<li>You are less inclined to want to cook recipes with longer steps.</li>
				<li>You have less room for appliances.</li>
				<li>Trying to move clutter while cooking is stressful, increasing the chance of errors.</li>
				<li>Clutter could overflow to areas like the stove, where it could impede daily function</li>
				<li>Taking time to properly organize a kitchen can be difficult and time consuming.</li>
				<li>A small kitchen makes it difficult for more than one person to be active in the space.</li>
			</ol>
			<h3>Insights</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>A lack of counter space can result in less real estate for foods, which for some people may leave certain food items forgotten about. Out of sight, out of mind.</li>
				<li>Filling the space in a small kitchen happens much sooner than if you had extra room, and can be daunting to clean up or keep less cluttered.</li>
				<li>Having an overly cluttered kitchen may make you less inclined to want to cook in the first place as there are extra steps involved.</li>
				<li>Some people prefer to have appliances and utensils handy by keeping them out on their counters, leading to clutter making either option problematic in different ways.</li>
				<li>There are ways to organize a kitchen neatly, but they often require a product to assist or more appliances which are expensive.</li>

			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To get an idea of the struggle involved with this issue, I interviewed a friend who has complained about this issue and followed them while they cooked. After, I made a graph detailing the peaks and lows of their emotions during the process. The cooking process started steadily as they searched for a recipe and prepped ingredients. However, tragedy struck midway through cooking chicken when a bowl on the counter's edge containing cut carrots tumbled onto the floor. This accident caused a significant dip in motivation, only partially recovering by the end of the process.</p>
