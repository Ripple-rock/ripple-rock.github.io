            <p><center>My everyday object. I typically start my mornings with a bagel or toast. This toaster is relativley old but it gets the job done and is something I consistently use everyday so I decided to model my project using it. This model was done in Blender, starting off with a cube and modeling it into a basic shape, then I went over it and smoothed everything out and added the buttons and knobs.</center></p>
            
            <div class="galleryLink">

            </div>
            
            <p><center>I did some sketches of the important features of the toaster I wanted to capture. Making note of the buttons and knobs that 
			I wanted to include. Then I got a ruler and measured out the dimensions. It is worth noting that my measurements are in inches, and the actual model was done in M as a stand in for inches.</center></p>

                <a href="#"> <img src="./render images/dim-layout.png"></a>
            <div class="projOverlay">Technical Drawing</div>      
            </div>
			
			<p><center>Blender doesn't have an option to make an object 2D or to easily get dimensions, so I measured each object and annotated it and took screenshots and then assembled them together.</center></p>

            </div>
			
			<p><center>Screenshot of the overall dimensions of the model. Again the dimensions are in M as a stand in for inches. I tried to stay acurrate to scale in the begging but somewhere along the way I scaled the object and lost the original dimensions. I recovered for the most part by scaling down the model to closely resemble the dimensions. </center></p>

			<p><center>Wireframe image to show internal structure. As you can see the inside has some extra verticies that I noticed once I was close to finished and I couldn't clean them up without causing issues.</center></p>

            </div>
            
			<p><center>This is the front view of the model before I added textures to all the parts. I struggled most with aligning the text on the buttons, especialy the indicators around the knob. I'll admit it took me close to an hour just to get it perfectly aligned around the knob.</center></p>

            </div>
				<p><center>The oval on the side here is where I wanted to overlay the logo. I didn't realize at the time how much of an undertaking it would end up being, taking me a couple hours to figure out how to apply it, and an hour more to make it look good</center></p>

            <div class="projOverlay">Full render front view</div>      
            </div>
			
			<p><center>The full render of the front view. It took a long time to mark individual areas and create a material for them, in Blender I got very comfortable with the basics of textures and using nodes to stylize surfaces to make them shiny, glossy, or metallic and other aspects. I tried to model the area with the buttons to have a plastic look. The outsides I gave sort of a burnished metal look, so it appeared shiny, but not too shiny. In between the outsides has a slightly more glossy, gray plastic look. The lever closely resembles the actual toaster's shape but I chose to make the logo darker so it is easier to see, and the lever itself is a shiny metal material. </center></p>

            <div class="projOverlay">Full render side view</div>      
            </div>
            
			<p><center>The side is in a burnished metal set to a turquoise color to match the actual toaster. The logo on the side has a shiny gloss over a dark reflective metal surface. On the actual toaster there is a silver ring that runs around the logo but I couldn't get it to look right so I chose to omit this.</center></p>

            <div class="projOverlay">Full side view- diffent angle</div>      
            </div>

            <p><center>I chose another angle of the side to show the reflective surfaces at other angles</center></p>

            <div class="projOverlay">Back-left full render</div>      
            </div>
			
			 <p><center>This angle shows the back and other side. The back is made of the same material that a majority of the front side is made of.</center></p>

                <a href="#"> <img src="./render images/back-cycle.png"></a>
            <div class="projOverlay">Back full render</div>      
            </div>
				 
			<p><center>Overall this project took me a long time, and I spent extra time in Blender trying out different materials and shaders and other features as well as watching some Youtube tutorials. I feel that I've grown a lot in Blender since my Kingss and Queens project, both in modeling, and overall finesse in Blender. I was proud of how the render came out, but I think I still have plenty to work on. If I did this again, I think I would like to make a separate inner grate to better simulate a toaster, and I think I could've done better beveling the sides out to be more rounded.</center></p>
